  <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <p>A financial software application with a legacy UI needed an update to reduce user frustration, decrease support calls, and increase customer satisfaction. Several previous usability studies had proven that users much preferred a proposed new UI design that increased their efficiency and virtually eliminated any need for training on the interface.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <p>Decision makers involved in the software, however, were not recognizing that existing usability problems were detrimental to the user experience. By introducing SUS scoring into usability testing, additional metrics could demonstrate the differences between the legacy UI and the proposed new interface and user experience.</p>

    <p>As explained by <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html">usability.gov</a>, “the System Usability Scale (SUS) provides a ‘quick and dirty, reliable tool for measuring the usability. It consists of a 10 item questionnaire with five response options for respondents; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree. Originally created by John Brooke in 1986, it allows you to evaluate a wide variety of products and services, including hardware, software, mobile devices, websites and applications.”</p>

    <p>A usability test was designed to ask users to accomplish basic tasks relating to finding items called “action plans” in a list. Users would be presented two versions of a page—the old legacy version and the new version (codenamed Brio)—and asked to complete the same tasks in each version. To control for order bias, half the users were presented with the legacy version first, the other half with the new version first.</p>

  <div class="col">
    <p>After completing—or attempting to complete—the tasks in one of the two versions, users was asked to provide feedback via the SUS questionnaire, which they filled out privately. Users were then presented with the alternate version, worked through the tasks, and again filled out the SUS questionnaire.</p>

    <p>Our hypothesis was that the new Brio designs would score higher than the old legacy designs. We also expected SUS scoring on the old legacy designs to confirm what we had learned during heuristic evaluation: that the pages were difficult to use, violated many basic rules of thumb, and did not meet user expections.</p>

  <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <p>While previous usability studies had proven increases in task completion, efficiency, and user satisfaction in new designs, quantitative SUS statistics made previously qualitative data very clear to stakeholders.</p>
    <p>Product owners and managers were able to incorporate this data into business cases to support predicted outcomes like higher customer satisfaction and conversion of NPS detractors to promoters.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <p>The qualitative feedback we receive during usability studies is infinitely valuable to the UX team. Learning the likes and the dislikes, the task completion successes and failures, the efficiency gains or losses—that’s the data that product and interface designers need to improve the user experience. Raw numbers doesn’t tell us the valuable “why.” But they do show stakeholders the needle can be moved if the right work is done.</p>
