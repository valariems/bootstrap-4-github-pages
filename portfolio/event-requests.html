      <p>While at OrgSync in 2014, I redesigned a complex process used by universities to review and approve events run by student organizations. From initial exploration of the problem and goals, through prototypes to hand off to development, this feature upgrade was widely regarded as one of the top successes that the platform had seen.</p>

      <h2 class="text-dark-blue">The problem</h2>
      <p>Users were running into roadblocks trying to use a very popular but dated tool in the OrgSync web application. Feature requests and support tickets were growing steadily.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
      <h2 class="text-dark-blue">The solution</h2>
      <p>Development time was slated to rework the tool from the ground up, to make the tool easy to use and learn, while meeting the needs of a variety of users.</p>

      <h2 class="text-dark-blue">Define user roles</h2>
      <p>This tool would be used by vastly different users with different interests and goals. Defining these users, who we knew very well and heard from often, allowed us to keep them in the forefront of the design process and ensure that we met their needs. Through discussions with these customers and stakeholders, we examined the validity of these roles, as well as whether roles could be combined or if additional permission levels were needed.</p>

      <p>We knew, from months if not years of customer feedback, the desires of our users. It was time to take a comprehensive look at prior feedback from support tickets and idea board requests, and expand on it through customer interviews, heuristic evaluations, and data research. The result was a comprehensive list of over 50 wants and needs that the new tool should achieve for a successful redesign.</p>

      <p>Because of the complexity of this new feature (remember the 50+ user wants?), we reviewed this both internally with multiple teams—UX/UI, development, customer success, and leadership—and with customers. Multiple iterations were designed to simplify the complexity and test ideas against each other. The significant project scope also necessitated constant communication between design and development to adjust concepts as needed during production.</p>
