    <p>In 2011, I worked for a startup that offered a SaaS product to help sports teams and leagues manage their activities and players. The existing marketing website had been created prior to my arrival and was due for an update. The home page was simply a signup form and a clipart-style graphic.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <p>The home page layout was very similar to Facebook’s home page. The key difference between Facebook and AllPlayers.com, though, was that most people who visited facebook.com had an idea of what Facebook could do for them. That wasn’t true of AllPlayers.com.</p>

  <div class="col-md-12">
    <p>The new home page design immediately presented the visitor with four things:</p>
    <ol class="hang-number">
      <li><span class="hang-circle-number">A large headline telling what this site offers in less than three seconds</li>
      <li>A brief introduction and value statement</li>
      <li>A large call to action (albeit one that does not meet accessibility standards, a mistake I would not make today)</li>
      <li>A large hero image showing a desktop product with a better UI than its competitors, and a responsive mobile version, which was a differentiator in 2011.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Below the fold, the content continues by targeting key audiences to explain the features and benefits of the product as it relates specifically to them, highlights two important features for all users, then wraps up with secondary call to action that also functions as a lead generator.</p>
